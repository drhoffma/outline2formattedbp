In this tutorial you will will learn how to train a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Keras on the Fashion MNIST dataset, enabling you to classify fashion images and categories.

The Fashion MNIST dataset is meant to be a (slightly more challenging) drop-in replacement for the (less challenging) MNIST dataset.

Just like the MNIST digit dataset, the Fashion MNIST dataset includes:

60,000 training examples 10,000 testing examples 10 classes
2<em>8x2</em>8 grayscale images

The ten fashion class labels includes:
<ol>
 	<li>T-shirt/top</li>
 	<li>Trouser/pants</li>
 	<li>Pullover shirt</li>
 	<li>Dress</li>
 	<li>Coat</li>
 	<li>Sandal</li>
 	<li>Shirt</li>
 	<li>Sneaker</li>
 	<li>Bag</li>
 	<li>Ankle boot</li>
</ol.

Throughout the rest of this tutorial you will learn how to train a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Keras on the Fashion MNIST dataset, giving you not only hands-on experience working with the Keras library, but also your first taste of clothing/fashion classification.

Fashion MNIST with Keras and Deep Learning

In the first part of this tutorial we will review the Fashion MNIST dataset, including how to download it to your system.

From there we’ll define a simple CNN network using the Keras deep learning library.

Finally, we’ll train our CNN model on the Fashion MNIST dataset, evaluate it, and review the results.

Let’s go ahead and get started!

The Fashion MNIST dataset

lab-episode-1-fashion-mnist-c7af60029836

The Fashion MNIST dataset was created by the e-commrece company, Zalando.

As they note on the their official GitHub repo for the Fashion MNIST dataset, there are a few problems with the standard MNIST digit recognition dataset:

1. It’s far too easy for standard machine learning algorithms to obtain 97%+ accuracy.
2. It’s even easier for deep learning models to achieve 99%+ accuracy.

3. The dataset is overused

4. MNIST cannot represent modern computer vision tasks Zalando therefore created the Fashion MNIST dataset as a drop-in replacement for MNIST.

The Fashion MNIST dataset is identical to the MNIST dataset in terms of training set size, testing set size, number of class labels, and image dimension:

60,000 training examples 10,000 testing examples 10 classes
2<em>8x2</em>8 grayscale images

If you’ve ever trained a network on the MNIST digit dataset then you can simply change one or two lines of code and train the same network on the Fashion MNIST dataset.

To find out how, keep reading.

Obtaining the Fashion MNIST dataset

Note to Hoffman:

Give Margaret Maynard-Reid an additional callout in the post itself for putting together such an awesome illustration. Definitely want to give her credit where credit is due.

There are two ways to obtain the Fashion MNIST dataset.

If you are using the Keras deep learning library, the Fashion MNIST dataset is actually built directly into the <span class="lang:python decode:true  crayon-inline ">datasets</span> module of Keras:

CODE load_fashion_mnist.py

Otherwise, if you are using another deep learning library you can download it directory from the the official Fashion MNIST GitHub repo.

Defining a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

We’ll be defining a very simple Convolutional Neural Network to train on the Fashion MNIST dataset.

We’ll call this CNN “MiniVGGNet” since:

1. The model is inspired by its bigger brother, VGGNet 2. The model has VGGNet characteristics, including:

Only using <em>3x3</em> CONV filter.

Stacking multiple CONV layers before applying a max- pooling operation

We’ve used the MiniVGGNet model before a handful of times on the PyImageSearch blog but we’ll briefly review it here today as a matter of completeness.

Open up a new file, name it <span class="lang:sh decode:true crayon-inline">minivggnet.py</span>, and insert the following code:

Review <span class="lang:sh decode:true crayon-inline">minivggnet.py</span> 
<pre class="start-line:1 lang:python decode:true " title="Fashion MNIST with Keras and Deep Learning">Codeblock 1 Lines 1-25</pre>

Implementing the Fashion MNIST training script with Keras

Now that MiniVGGNet is implemented we can move on to the driver script used:

1. Load the Fashion MNIST dataset

2. Train MiniVGGNet on Fashion MNIS.

Create a new file named <span class="lang:sh decode:true crayon-inline">fashion_mnist.py</span>, open it up, and insert the following code:

Fashion MNIST results

We are now ready to train our Keras CNN on the Fashion MNIST dataset!

Make sure you have used the “<strong><em>"Downloads"</em></strong>” section of this blog post to download the source code and project structure.

From there, open up a terminal, navigate to where you downloaded the

code, and execute the following command: COMMAND

Classification report IMAGE

plot.png

Here you can see that our network obtained 94% accuracy on the testing set.

The model classified the “trouser” class 100% correct but seemed to struggle quite a bit with the “shirt” class (~81% accurate).

According to our plot in <strong>Figure X</strong> there appears to be very little overfitting.

A deeper architecture with data augmentation would likely lead to higher accuracy.

Below I have included a sample of fashion classifications:

As you can see our network is performing quite well at fashion recognition.

Will this model work for fashion images outside the

Fashion MNIST dataset?

At this point you are properly wondering if the model we just trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset would be directly applicable to images outside the Fashion MNIST dataset.

The short answer is “No, unfortunately not."

The longer answer requires a bit of explanation.

To start, keep in mind that the Fashion MNIST dataset is meant to be a

drop-in replacement for the MNIST dataset, implying that our images have already been processed.

Each image has been:

Converted to grayscal.

Segmented, such that all background pixels are black and all foreground pixels are some gray, non-black pixel intensity Resized to 2<em>8x2</em>8 pixels

For real-world fashion and clothing images you would have to preprocess your data in the same manner as the Fashion MNIST dataset.

And furthermore, even if you could preprocess your dataset in the
exact same manner, the model still might not be transferrable to real-

world images.

Instead, you should train a CNN on example images that will mimic the images the CNN “sees” when deployed to a real-world situation.

To do that you will likely need to utilize multi-label classification and multi- output networks.

For more details on both of these techniques be sure to refer to the following tutorials:

1. Multi-label classification with Keras
2. Keras: Multiple outputs and multiple losses

<h2>Summary</h2>

In this tutorial you learned how to train a simple CNN on the Fashion MNIST dataset using Keras.

The Fashion MNIST dataset is meant to be a drop-in replacement for the standard MNIST digit recognition dataset, including:

60,000 training examples 10,000 testing examples 10 classes
2<em>8x2</em>8 grayscale images

While the Fashion MNIST dataset is slightly more challenging than the MNIST digit recognition dataset, it unfortunately cannot be used directly in real-world fashion classification tasks, unless you preprocess your images in the exact same manner as Fashion MNIST (segmentation, thresholding, grayscale conversion, resizing).

In most real-world fashion application tasks this process will be near impossible.

You should use Fashion MNIST as a drop-in replacement for the MNIST digit dataset; however, if you are interested in actually recognizing fashion items in real-world images you should refer to the following two tutorials:

1. Multi-label classification with Keras

2. Keras: Multiple outputs and multiple losse.

Both of the tutorials linked to above will guide you in building a more robust fashion classification system.
